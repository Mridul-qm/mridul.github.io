        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p> Hi and Namaste to the viewer.
            I am Mridul Kandpal. I belong from a small hilly town Almora in the state of Uttarakhand.
            I am presently doing my PhD in Physics from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I did my Masters from IISc and Bachelors from KiroriMal College in Delhi University.
            My PhD research includes quantum computation which is a burning area of technology and science at the moment.
            I usually work with superconducting circuit architecture for the implementation of quantum computation.
            My work involves experimental realisation of superconducting circuits which could help in us in a certain problem for example implementation of a two qubit gate with a faster readout and short gate times.
            
        </p>
